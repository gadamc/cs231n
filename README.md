# Seattle Deep Learning Meeupt: Project cs231n
 
This is the project page for the Seattle Deep Learning Meetup Sub-group. 

We are going through the Stanford CS231n course; discussing lectures, homeworks and
will eventually build a project together.

Course Syllabus: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/syllabus.html

## Group meetup schedule

We will try to meet once per week to discuss the lectures and work together on the assignments. 

Here is our current schedule for the remainder of the year. 

## New Members

A few new folks showed up on Jan 30th meetup and were interested in starting to work on this.

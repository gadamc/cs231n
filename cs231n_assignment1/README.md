# Assignment 1

Details about this assignment can be found [on the course webpage](http://cs231n.github.io/), under Assignment #1 of Spring 2017.

## Setup

The Course website contains instructions on how to set up a `virtualenv` and install all the code.

However, instead of a `virtualenv`, I've set up a `conda` environment.  Here is what I remember doing to set this up.


```
>conda create -n cs231n_assignment1 python=3.5
>source activate cs231n_assignment1
>pip install -r requirements.txt
>conda install jupyter
>conda install matplotlib (might be necessary if you run into a weird runtime error, which I did the first time)
>jupyter notebook
```
